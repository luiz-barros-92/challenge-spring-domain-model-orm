You must create a project in **Spring Boot** with **Java** and **H2 Database**, and implement the conceptual model according to the following specification. In addition, you must seed the database according to the object diagram below.

### SPECIFICATION - EVENT System:
We want to build a system to manage the information of participants in the activities of an academic event. The activities of this event can be, for example, lectures, courses, practical workshops, etc. Each activity that takes place has a name, description, price, and can be divided into several
time blocks (for example: an HTML course can take place in two blocks, and it is necessary to store the day and the start and end times of the block of that day). For each participant, we want to register their name and email.
